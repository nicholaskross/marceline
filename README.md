# marceline
Task management software I built for myself. It turned out not to be the most efficient way to organize my tasks, but you may find it helpful.


Because this program was never used on a day-to-day basis, installation is a bit complex:

1. Make sure Python 3.6+ and Pip are installed.
2.
```
pip install tinydb
```
3.
```
pip install numpy
```
4.
```
pip install appjar
```
5. Download the whole "marcline" folder.
6. Run marceline.pyw
7. Enjoy your newfound productivity!

Use the marcy.py module to write your own task-adding and task-cleaning scripts!
